# Solidity Development Environment Template

This template is designed to streamline the development of Solidity smart contracts by incorporating a suite of tools that facilitate compiling, testing, linting, and more. It leverages the robustness of [Buidler](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler), [TypeChain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain), [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/), [Waffle](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle), [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint), [Solcover](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage), and [Prettier Plugin Solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity) to create a comprehensive and efficient development environment.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have `node.js` and `yarn` installed on your system. These tools are necessary for managing dependencies and running scripts defined in this template.

### Setup

1. **Clone this Template**: Use the "Use this template" button on GitHub to create a new repository with this setup.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `yarn install` to fetch all necessary dependencies.

### Workflow

#### Compile Contracts

- **Buidler**: Compiles smart contracts and prepares them for deployment. Use `yarn compile` to compile your contracts.

#### Generate TypeChain Artifacts

- **TypeChain**: Enhances TypeScript support by generating type definitions for smart contracts. After compilation, run `yarn build` to generate these artifacts.

#### Linting

- **Solidity Linting**: With `Solhint`, ensure your Solidity code adheres to best practices and coding standards. Run `yarn lint:sol`.
- **TypeScript Linting**: Ensure your TypeScript code quality with ESLint. Run `yarn lint:ts`.

#### Testing

- **Waffle**: Utilize Waffle for writing and running your smart contract tests. It integrates with Mocha and Chai for a seamless testing experience. Execute `yarn test` to run your tests.

#### Code Coverage

- **Solcover**: Generate a code coverage report for your smart contracts to identify untested paths. Use `yarn coverage`.

#### Clean Artifacts

- To clean up artifacts, coverage reports, and cache generated during development, run `yarn clean`.

## Best Practices

- **Regularly Update Dependencies**: To leverage the latest features and security improvements, regularly update your development dependencies.
- **Adhere to Solidity Style Guide**: Follow the [Solidity Style Guide](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html) to maintain readability and consistency across your smart contracts.
- **Continuous Integration**: Consider integrating a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and linting, ensuring your codebase remains robust and error-free.
